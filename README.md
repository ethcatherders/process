## Ethereum Cat Herders

### Purpose
Ethereum Cat Herders is a group of experienced project managers to help out with Ethereum project management. With initial goal to facilitate inter-team communication, it aims to help with tasks such as All Core Devs meetings notes, speed up the upgrade preparation process leading to a more consistent stream of improvements to the protocol. 

By following a structured PM process and creating a communication channel, it aims to help Ethereum stakeholders (such as miners, pools, exchanges, testnets, the client development teams etc.) who are critical to a release of the Ethereum protocol to mainnet. 

As Lane Rettig suggested in his blog *[Decentralizing Ethereum project management](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/decentralizing-ethereum-project-management-ffff4c09d0ea)*, “We hope that this group will play a significant ongoing role in Ethereum governance alongside other grassroots initiatives such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians and #EIP0. “
